<b>R code for analysis of the Tasmanian Thylacine Sighting Records Database (TTSRD)</b>

- Analyses can be driven through the method script, written in R (it requires loading the functions script).
- R code for running all analyses are in /full_analysis, and just the spatial modelling in /spatial_analysis
- The reduced CSV form of the database (loaded in the R scripts), along with GIS layers for the spatial analysis, are in /data
- The original full XLS database, with all 1237 records (1 record per row) is in /ttsrd_database
- The revised XLS databse (v1.1) and .CSV files with 1223 records are also in /ttsrd_database (after some museum-record errors and duplicates were removed)
- Attachments (original sighting descriptions and documentation) for each TTSRD record are in /ttsrd_attachments as JPG images
